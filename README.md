# Game Recommendation System  

## Project Overview  
This project develops a recommendation system where users upload a game or its poster, and the system suggests similar games based on features like genre, platform, and rating.  

## Dataset  
We are using the [Games After 1 Year](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wiliamlee/games_after_1_years) dataset from Hugging Face to train our model.  

## Motivation  
Video game recommendation is a growing field that helps players discover games they may enjoy based on their preferences. Our goal is to create an intelligent system that enhances user experience by providing accurate suggestions.
